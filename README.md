# Lightweight Beaconchain Explorer

<b>This is a work in progress project!\
It's not ready to be used in any way yet.</b>

## What is this?
This project is planned to become a lightweight beaconchain explorer.

A Beaconchain explorer is a tool that allows users to view and interact with the data on the Ethereum Beacon Chain. It is similar to a blockchain explorer, which allows users to view data on a blockchain such as the current state of transactions and blocks - but focussed on exploring the beaconchain.

This "lightweight" explorer is planned to proxy most of the queries to an underlying standard beacon node api, which makes it a lot easier and cheaper to run (no 3rd party proprietary database like bigtables required)
